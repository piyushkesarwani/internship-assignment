# Fyle-internship-assignment
This is the assignment assigned to me for frontend web development role. 

The assignment is to build a web app using OpenLibrary API to read and display the list of books based on the user input. The results has to be displayed on the basis of the book's subjects, title of the book, or the author's name.

The assumptions that I've made in this project are: 

1. I have applied offset and limit to the OpenLIbrary API. So the results will be limited to 50 only.
2. User can see results by entering the book subjects, book's title, and the book's authors name.
3. Pagination supports 10 results per page on the table.

Functionalities: 

1. User can search books based on the book title, author name, and the subject.
2. Results are shown in Table format.
3. Loading animation during API call.
4. Pagination support.
5. User can also search any other subjects (besides the trending subjects lists) and the results will be displayed based on the subject name entered.
